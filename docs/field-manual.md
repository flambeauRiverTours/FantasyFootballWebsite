This manual assumes no prior familiarity with Azure, bicep, EF Core, D3, CSS or
GitHub Actions. Where a step needs background, the background is here rather
than assumed.

**Completed tasks have been cut.** M0-M2, T24's build steps, T25-T28 and T32 are
built; what survived of them is the *Standing traps* section below, and the
reasoning lives in [`amendments.md`](amendments.md) and
[`lessons.md`](../tasks/lessons.md). This file is now what is left to build. Where a command can fail in a way whose error message points
somewhere unhelpful, that is called out.

### Conventions

- Shell blocks are **bash**. On Windows use **Git Bash**, not `cmd` or
  PowerShell — `find`, `grep` and `$VAR` all mean different things there.
- **No resource name appears in this file.** Set `RG` to your resource group
  once and every block below discovers the rest from it. The repository is
  going public and a name is an identifier (**A2**).
- `±` marks a soft estimate that could run double.
- Anything marked **Watch out** has already cost someone a day.

# M7 · Motion and polish — optional · 7.5 h

Optional throughout. Cut the whole milestone and the site still does its job — which is the test every task here should pass before you spend an hour on it.

## T51 · Motion setup — 1.0 h

`npm i motion` — the package formerly published as `framer-motion`, imported from `motion/react`. It is the right choice here because it is declarative, which means D9 still holds: React owns every node and Motion animates props.

```
import { LazyMotion, domAnimation, m, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react";

<LazyMotion features={domAnimation}>
  <App />
</LazyMotion>
```

The `m` component with `LazyMotion` cuts the bundle to roughly a fifth of a plain `motion` import. Not that Static Web Apps’ free bandwidth will notice — it is first paint that matters.

> **Watch out**
>
> `useReducedMotion()` is not optional; T40 already commits you to honouring it. Read it once near the root and pass a duration of zero rather than scattering conditionals — a motion system with one opt-out is maintainable, a hundred is not.

## T52 · Table layout animation — 1.0 h

The single most valuable animation on this site, and it is one prop.

```
<m.tr layout key={team.rosterId}
      transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 40 }}>
```

When the standings re-sort mid-afternoon, rows physically slide past one another. That makes the live-ness legible instead of merely claimed — a number quietly changing in place is invisible; a row overtaking another is not.

`key` must be `rosterId`, never the array index, or Motion animates the wrong rows into each other.

> **Watch out**
>
> **The 30-second poll will replay any entrance animation.** This is the trap that will actually bite. An `initial={{ opacity: 0 }}` anywhere inside the polled subtree flashes every thirty seconds and makes the page unusable during games. Gate it on first load:
>
> `initial={hasLoadedOnce ? false : { opacity: 0, y: 8 }}` — `false` tells Motion to jump straight to the target. `layout` is inherently safe, because it animates changes rather than mounts.
>

## T53 · Chart reveal and transitions — 2.0 h  ±

Draw-on for the line chart is a one-liner:

```
<m.path d={path} initial={{ pathLength: 0 }} animate={{ pathLength: 1 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.8, ease: "easeOut" }} />
```

> **Watch out**
>
> **Do not try to tween the `d` string between display modes.** Switching cumulative to per-week to vs-median changes the path shape, and Motion cannot meaningfully interpolate arbitrary path data — you get a smear or nothing. Two workable options: animate the underlying *values* and recompute the path each frame, or simply crossfade the old path out and the new one in.
>
> Crossfade is what the estimate assumes and is almost always enough. Reach for a path-interpolation library only if you have seen the crossfade and specifically disliked it.
>

For the radar, animate the polygon in by scaling from the centre rather than morphing points — same reasoning, and the reference circle should not animate at all. It is the fixed thing the shape is read against.

## T54 · Section transitions — 1.0 h

The View Transitions API costs nothing and degrades to an instant swap:

```
function go(next: Section) {
  if (!document.startViewTransition) return setSection(next);
  document.startViewTransition(() => flushSync(() => setSection(next)));
}
```

Supported in Chromium and Safari; check current Firefox support before leaning on it, and note that the guard above means you never have to care. Give shared elements a `view-transition-name` and they morph between sections rather than crossfading.

Motion’s `AnimatePresence` does the same job with more control and more code. Start with the native API and reach for `AnimatePresence` only if you need exit animations it cannot express.

## T55 · Football loader — 2.5 h

A football arcing back and forth while the site loads. Charming for four seconds, maddening for forty — so the whole design is about which wait it is bound to.

### Three timing bands

| Wait | What shows | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 400 ms | Nothing at all | The warm path is this fast. A loader that flashes for 80 ms is worse than none. |
| 0.4 – 4 s | The football | The band where a mascot is genuinely delightful. |
| 4 s + | Ball settles, copy appears | The cold-start case from D7. Past ten seconds people want an explanation, not a loop. |

### It goes in index.html, not in React

The loader has to paint before the bundle has loaded, so it cannot be a component — a React loader can only appear once React is mounted, which is precisely the part you are waiting for. Inline the markup and CSS in `index.html`; the app removes `#boot` on its first real render.

```
<div id="boot" role="status" aria-live="polite">
  <svg class="ball" viewBox="0 0 24 15" aria-hidden="true">
    <ellipse cx="12" cy="7.5" rx="11" ry="6.6" fill="#7A4A24"/>
    <path d="M2.5 7.5h19M9 4.6v5.8M12 4.1v6.8M15 4.6v5.8"
          stroke="#F6F1E8" stroke-width="1.1" stroke-linecap="round"/>
  </svg>
  <p class="why">Waking the database. This can take up to a minute.</p>
  <span class="sr">Loading standings</span>
</div>
```

```
@keyframes punt {
  0%   { offset-distance: 0%;   transform: scaleX(1);  }
  48%  { offset-distance: 100%; transform: scaleX(1);  }
  52%  { offset-distance: 100%; transform: scaleX(-1); }
  100% { offset-distance: 0%;   transform: scaleX(-1); }
}
@keyframes fadein { to { opacity: 1 } }

#boot        { opacity: 0; animation: fadein .25s ease .4s forwards; }
#boot .why   { opacity: 0; animation: fadein .4s  ease 4s   forwards; }
#boot .ball  {
  width: 64px;
  offset-path: path("M 10 104 Q 120 -12 230 104");
  offset-rotate: auto;                       /* nose follows the trajectory */
  animation: punt 2.2s cubic-bezier(.37,0,.63,1) infinite;
}
/* narrow screens throw it straight up instead — see below */

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  #boot .ball, #boot .spin, #boot .speed { animation: none; }
  #boot .ball { offset-distance: 50%; }
  #boot .speed { display: none; }
}
```

The two `scaleX` flips are what make the return trip work. `offset-rotate: auto` orients the ball to the path tangent, and that orientation does not reverse when the animation plays back toward 0% — so without the flip the ball flies tail-first on the way home. Flipping at the apex, where the ball is briefly side-on, hides the switch.

### Spin without rotating: the comic-book trick

A real spiral is rotation about the long axis, which barely alters the silhouette — so a CSS `rotate` spins the ball end over end and reads as a fumble. Cartoonists solve this with drawn arcs rather than rotation, and so should you. The two kinds say different things:

| Arcs | Placed | Read as |
|---|---|---|
| Speed lines | Outside the ball, trailing | Velocity — how fast it is travelling |
| Surface arcs | Clipped inside the ball | Spin — the skin turning under the laces |

Clipping is the whole trick. An arc drawn *on* the ball and slid sideways reads as a marking rotating away from you; the same arc drawn beside the ball reads as a motion streak. Both are cheap; only the clipped one produces spin.

```
<svg class="ball" viewBox="0 0 40 24">
  <defs><clipPath id="skin">
    <ellipse cx="20" cy="12" rx="11" ry="6.8"/>
  </clipPath></defs>

  <g class="speed">                        <!-- outside: velocity -->
    <path d="M6 8 q-5 4 0 8"/>
    <path d="M1 10 q-4 2 0 4"/>
  </g>

  <ellipse cx="20" cy="12" rx="11" ry="6.8" fill="#7A4A24"/>

  <g class="spin" clip-path="url(#skin)">  <!-- inside: rotation -->
    <path d="M12 3 q3.5 9 0 18"/>
    <path d="M22 3 q3.5 9 0 18"/>
    <path d="M32 3 q3.5 9 0 18"/>
    <path d="M42 3 q3.5 9 0 18"/>         <!-- the spare, see below -->
  </g>

  <path class="laces" d="M15 12h10M17 9.6v4.8M20 9.2v5.6M23 9.6v4.8"
        stroke="#F6F1E8" stroke-width="1.1" stroke-linecap="round"/>
</svg>
```

```
@keyframes turn  { to { transform: translateX(-10px) } }   /* == arc spacing */
@keyframes streak{ 0%,100% { opacity:.15 } 50% { opacity:.5 } }

.spin  { animation: turn .34s linear infinite; }
.spin path  { fill:none; stroke:#5C3417; stroke-width:1.1; opacity:.45; }
.speed { animation: streak .34s ease-in-out infinite; }
.speed path { fill:none; stroke:currentColor; stroke-width:1.2; opacity:.25; }
```

> **The two things that make or break it**
>
> **Translate by exactly one arc spacing, and draw one spare arc beyond the clip.** Arcs sit at x = 12, 22, 32 and the ball clips to roughly x ∈ [9, 31]. Translating by −10 moves each arc into its neighbour’s old position, so the end frame is identical to the start — an invisible loop. Without the fourth arc at x = 42 there is nothing to replace the one that left, and you get a visible hitch every third of a second.
>
> **Spin far faster than flight.** The arc takes 2.2 s; the spin cycle should be around 0.3 s. That contrast is what sells it — matched speeds read as a wobble, not a spiral.
>

The `scaleX(-1)` flip from the outbound-return keyframes handles both arc types for free: the speed lines stay behind the ball, and the surface arcs reverse their apparent direction, which is what genuinely happens when a spiralling ball flies back the other way.

One sizing note: at 34 px none of this detail reads. Take the loader ball to about 64 px — it is the only thing on screen, so it can afford to be the hero, and below roughly 48 px the arcs turn to mush and you may as well drop them.

### Narrow screens: throw it straight up

A 220 px horizontal arc is cramped on a 375 px phone, and it spends the one dimension a phone does not have. Throw the ball straight up instead — it suits the form factor, and it is the simpler animation of the two.

The vertical variant needs no `offset-path` at all, and no `scaleX` flip, because nothing reverses left to right:

```
@keyframes toss { from { translate: 0 62px } to { translate: 0 -62px } }

#boot .ball {                              /* mobile first */
  rotate: -90deg;                          /* nose up */
  animation: toss 1.05s cubic-bezier(0,0,.35,1) infinite alternate;
}

@media (min-width: 560px) {                /* the punt, on wider screens */
  #boot .ball {
    rotate: 0deg;
    offset-path: path("M 10 104 Q 120 -12 230 104");
    offset-rotate: auto;
    animation: punt 2.2s cubic-bezier(.37,0,.63,1) infinite;
  }
}
```

**Gravity is free here.** An ease-out curve decelerates toward its end, and `animation-direction: alternate` replays it reversed, which accelerates — so a single ease-out plus `alternate` produces genuine projectile motion: slowing as it rises, hanging at the apex, accelerating back down. No physics, no second keyframe set. Do not be tempted by `ease-in-out`, which hangs at *both* ends and reads as a float rather than a throw.

**The spin arcs need no changes at all.** Rotating the carrier by −90° rotates its children with it, so the clipped arcs still slide across the ball’s short axis in local coordinates — the same `translateX(-10px)`, the same spare arc, the same loop. Only the carrier's motion differs between the two layouts.

Using the individual `translate` and `rotate` properties rather than a combined `transform` is what keeps this clean: the toss animates `translate`, the orientation sits on `rotate`, and the punt keyframes still own `transform` for their `scaleX` flip. Three properties, no collisions.

> **Watch out**
>
> **Drop the speed lines on narrow screens.** Trailing lines must sit below the ball while it rises and above it while it falls, and with `alternate` there is no keyframe at which to flip them. Rather than build a second animation for a decoration, hide them: `#boot .speed { display: none }` below the breakpoint. The spin arcs carry the effect on their own, and a phone-sized loader is better with less in it anyway.
>

> **Watch out**
>
> **First load only.** Like every other animation here, this must not reappear on the 30-second poll. Tie it to `#boot`, which is removed once and never recreated.
>
> The easing above is symmetric in and out, which reads as a lob. For a flatter, harder throw use a linear horizontal traverse and let the arc height do the work.
>

`offset-path: path()` is supported across current Chromium, Safari and Firefox. Where it is not, the ball simply sits still at the start of the path and the fade still runs — an acceptable degradation for a loading state, and one more reason to keep the explanatory copy doing the real work.

# Deferred · the rest of M3

Moved behind M4 on 2026-09-14. None is blocked on effort; each waits on
something that does not exist yet. Rationale for each is in
[`tasks/todo.md`](../tasks/todo.md) under *Deferred*.

## T29 · Season chain walk — 2.0 h

Sleeper links each season's league to the one before it. Start at the configured
league ID and follow `previous_league_id` backwards, upserting a `League` row per
hop.

```csharp
var id = options.CurrentLeagueId;
var seen = new HashSet<string>();

while (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(id) && id != "0" && seen.Add(id))
{
    var league = await sleeper.GetLeagueAsync(id, ct);
    await UpsertLeagueAsync(league, ct);
    id = league.PreviousLeagueId;
}
```

The `seen` set is not paranoia — a malformed chain pointing at itself would loop
forever against a rate-limited API. Sleeper uses the string `"0"` as well as null
to mean "no previous league", so test both.

Merge `League:SeasonOverrides` from configuration after the walk, for seasons the
chain cannot reach.

**Watch out — this is unexercisable today.** 2026 is the first season (A4), so
`previous_league_id` is null and the loop runs once. Write it, test it against
fixtures, and expect its first real run at the August 2027 rollover.

## T30 · Historical backfill job — 2.5 h

An explicitly triggered function — not a timer, not a request path — that takes a
season, walks weeks 1 to 18, and writes every `WeekScore` with `IsFinal = true`.

Roughly 21 calls per season. It goes through the T11 token bucket like everything
else, so it self-throttles and takes about half a minute. Make it idempotent:
upsert on the composite key, so re-running after a solver fix is safe and
expected.

**Watch out — do not wire this to a missing-season request.** A visitor would
wait twenty seconds for a page, and a crawler hitting `?season=1998` repeatedly
would generate bursts against Sleeper for seasons that never existed. The API
already returns 404 with the available list; backfill is something you run
deliberately.

## T31 · Migrations in the pipeline — 2.5 h  ±

The GitHub runner has a different IP on every run, so the SQL firewall must be
opened for it and closed again — including when the migration fails.

```yaml
- name: Open firewall for runner
  run: |
    IP=$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)
    SQL_SERVER=$(az sql server list -g "$RESOURCE_GROUP" --query "[0].name" -o tsv | tr -d '
')
    echo "SQL_SERVER=$SQL_SERVER" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
    az sql server firewall-rule create -g "$RESOURCE_GROUP" -s "$SQL_SERVER" -n "gh-${{ github.run_id }}" --start-ip-address "$IP" --end-ip-address "$IP"

- name: Apply migrations
  run: dotnet ef database update --project src/FantasyLeague.Data --startup-project src/FantasyLeague.Functions

- name: Close firewall
  if: always()
  run: az sql server firewall-rule delete -g "$RESOURCE_GROUP" -s "$SQL_SERVER" -n "gh-${{ github.run_id }}"
```

**Watch out — `if: always()` on the close step is the whole point.** Without it,
a failed migration leaves the database open to a public IP that will shortly
belong to someone else's CI run.

Name the rule after the run ID rather than a fixed `gh-runner`: two concurrent
deploys would otherwise collide on one rule name, and the second one's close step
would delete the first one's access mid-migration.

Soft-estimated because the deploy identity needs both the firewall grant and
schema rights, and a connection timeout and a permission denial look identical in
the log.

Remember `RESOURCE_GROUP` must be set as **job-level** `env:` from
`secrets.AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` — the `secrets` context is not available in
workflow-level `env:`, and an unquoted empty value makes `-g` swallow the next
flag rather than failing cleanly.
